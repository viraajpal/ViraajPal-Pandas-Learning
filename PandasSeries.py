#Pandas Series

#Create a simple Pandas Series from a list:

import pandas as pd

a = [1, 7, 2]

myvar = pd.Series(a)

print(myvar)

#Return the first value of the Series:

print(myvar[0])

#Create your own labels:



a = [1, 7, 2]

myvar = pd.Series(a, index = ["x", "y", "z"])

print(myvar)

#Return the value of "y":

print(myvar["y"])

#Create a simple Pandas Series from a dictionary:

calories = {"day1": 420, "day2": 380, "day3": 390}

myvar = pd.Series(calories)

print(myvar)

#Create a Series using only data from "day1" and "day2":


calories = {"day1": 420, "day2": 380, "day3": 390}

myvar = pd.Series(calories, index = ["day1", "day2"])

print(myvar)

#Create a DataFrame from two Series:

data = {
  "calories": [420, 380, 390],
  "duration": [50, 40, 45]
}

myvar = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(myvar)
